Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, have total of 29 percent
According to the first preliminary results of the early parliament elections in Austria have brought about a perceptible weakening of both parties in the present large coalition and a significant boost for the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current head, Wilhelm Molterer, is being severely jolted, suffered particularly great losses.
Conversely, the campaign leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, however, it has lost 5.5 percent of votes since the last elections in 2006.
ÖVP, which with its 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of votes, fared even worse.
These are the worst results of both large parties in Austrian post-war history, and particularly for the People's Party, who urged the early elections, it is literally a catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party still had a significant lead on SPÖ in the polls.
Voters, however, apparently punished them for letting the government flounder.
In the first reactions to the results, there were already speculations about the possible resignation of the party head and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
